Plan Update 17:
- [x] Explained Project Structure: `main.go` is the server, `cmd/migrate/main.go` is the one-time DB setup tool.
- [x] Refactored: Moved `main.go` to `cmd/server/main.go` to match standard Go layout.
- Next Task: Implement WhatsApp Order Confirmation.
- Strategy: Create `internal/service/notification.go` and call it inside `PlaceOrder`.
